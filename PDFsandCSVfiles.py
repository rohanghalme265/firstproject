#PDFs and CSV files in python:--
'''
*CSV stands for comma seperated variables and is a very common output for spreadsheet programs
*EXAMPLE:
        *Name,Hours,Rate
        *David, 20, 15
        *Claire, 40, 20

*Note,that while its possible to export excel files and Google spreadsheets to.csv files,it only exports the information.
*Things like formulas, images, and macros can not be within a .csv file.
*Simply put, a .csv file only contains the raw data from the spreadsheet

**Other libraries to consider:
     > Pandas
         < Full data analysis library,can work with almost any tabular data type.
         < Runs visulizations and analysis.

     >Openpyxl
         < Designed specifically for Excel files.
         < Retains a lot of Excel specific functionality.
         < Supports Excel formulas.
         < python-excel.org tracks various other Excel based Python libraries.

     >Google sheets python API
         < Direct Pyhton interface for working with Google Spreadsheets.
         < Allows you to directly make changes to the spreadsheets hosted online.
         < More complex syntax, but available in many programming languages.

** The common factor between all of these spreadsheet programs is that they can always export to .csv.
